This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app makes an axios call to https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json each time the page is reloaded. However, if building this for production, I would, instead, store the information and make one call per day to the url.

### Setup

First, you'll want to install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Now you should be able to run:
```
npm start
```

This command runs the app in the development mode.

You will see any lint errors in the console.
